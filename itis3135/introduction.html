                <li>Academic Background: I am a junior working on my degree in Computer Science with a concentration in AI, Robotics, and Gaming.</li>
                <li>Background in this Subject: I took my first programming class in high school and absolutely loved it. That is what led me to my current field of study.</li>

                <li>Courses I'm Taking and Why: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ITCS 3155 - Intro to Artificial Intelligence: I find AI fascinating and am interested in learning more about it. I donâ€™t know anything about actually implementing AI into my own work so I look forward to learning more about that process.</li>
                        <li>ITSC 2181 - Intro to Computer Systems: I have a solid understanding of computers and how they fundamentally function, but that knowledge is very surface level. I want to learn more detailed information regarding the way machines function.</li>
                        <li>ITSC 3155 - Software Engineering: It is a required course. That is it.</li>
                        <li>ITIS 3135 - Web App Design and Development: This class was recommended to me by my counselor. He told me that taking this class would be useful. I am excited to learn more about web development and building my own website.</li>
