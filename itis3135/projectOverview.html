        <h2>Client Project</h2>

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Website Description and Purpose:</strong> This website provides a detailed overview of each Airbnb location my mom manages (One Beach'in Cottage, Salt and Sand, and Loft De Vill). Each location has a printed welcome guide for the guests that includes lists of local restaurants and activities of interest. The website will additionally include a digital copy of this information that guests can access from a web browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Intended users of the website:</strong> Individuals interested in staying within the area can explore rental location beyond the information that can be listed on the Airbnb page. Guests that are currently staying at the Airbnb can use the site to view information regarding local activities and restaurant recommendations (information which used to only exist in the form of a binder within the house itself).</li>
            <li><strong>Overview of the content of the website:</strong> The home page will include a fun picture of the beach with a link to a list of the rental options in addition to information on the city and its surroundings. Each Airbnb will have its own page that includes overview information (such as property history, guest limit, and highlights), pictures, amenities, rules and policies, and a button that takes the user directly to the Airbnb page for the respective location. Within the header, the user can navigate back to the list of rentals or they can choose to view either restaurants or activies with local recommendations for visitors.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Dynamic Functionality on the Website</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Description:</strong> A photo gallery that displays a series of images on a page for a viewer. When one of those images are clicked on, the image expands to take up the full view. There are arrows on either side of the screen that allow the viewer to click through the other images within the gallery. There will be an 'x' button in the corner that allows the viewer to exit back to the page they were on.</li>
            <li><strong>Website Location:</strong> A gallery will be included on each of the individual rental pages (three in total)</li>
            <li><strong>Why:</strong> When looking at Airbnbs, people want to get a good idea of where they will be staying. Creating an easily navigated and enhanced view of images allowed possible renters to see a detailed depiction of the locations that is convinient to use.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/45348030?source_impression_id=p3_1732655000_P3yC8zfG2rZWUvZQ" target="_blank">Airbnb</a></li>
