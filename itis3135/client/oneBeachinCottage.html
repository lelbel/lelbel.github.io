            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Remodeled 1940s Cottage! Walking distance to the beach and restaurants. The Cottage offers guests a relaxing front porch with a table, chairs and a porch swing. The cottage sleeps 4 guest comfortably with 2 bedrooms with queen beds. The Bonus room can sleep 2 guests. Please inquire if you need to sleep 5 or 6. Remodeled kitchen has new cabinets and appliances. We offer books, games, wifi and a roku to watch your favorite streaming apps. A tall privacy fence ensures the safety of your pets.</p>
            <h3>The Space</h3>
            <p>As our guests, enjoy the entire house and yard. Relax in the company of your friends and loved ones on our covered porch with seating. If your group has more than 4, please let me know. I’ll provide additional linens and towels. There is a small bonus area in the back with seating that folds out to a bed and a tv. The sleeper sofa in the bonus room will accommodate 2 more people but it is tight and probably more appropriate for kids than adults. If you would like to bring more than 2 dogs, please contact me before reserving the cottage. Additional but reasonable fees apply. I live on the island and own the cottage. There are no additional admin fees on top of Airbnbs like some hosted by rental companies. Being a great host is a priority and I'm available for questions and problems. Thank you for considering One Beach'in Cottage, I look forward to hosting you!!!</p>
            <h3>Guest Access</h3>
            <p>Guests have access to our entire property.</p>
            <h3>Other Things to Note</h3>
            <p>Please note that the cottage is 800 sq ft. While it will sleep 6, please understand 6 people, especially 6 adults, will be extra cozy. The sleeper sofa is in the bonus room. I’m happy to answer any questions concerning the size of the space.</p>
