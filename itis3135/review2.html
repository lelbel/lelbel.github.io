            <h3>General Checklist Feedback</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your submission leads right to the page to be reviewed:</strong> All links included in the peer review spread sheet lead to the correct websites respectively &#9745;</li>
                <li><strong>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names, including scripts, images, etc..:</strong> The checklist says that names cannot contain uppercase letters, but I think it should be ok as long as naming conventions stay consistent. I'll ask on Campus Wire and put an update here. Almost all directory/file names are consistently camel cased. The name of your js file should start with a lower case letter to fit with the naming convention being used across the project.</li>
                <li><strong>Design</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><strong>Page has sufficient contrast/font sizing so as to be easy to read:</strong> White and black have good contrast, but the professor always talks about how we have to pick any other colors except those two. Maybe you could do an off-white background with really dark green text. The font size is a bit small.</li>
                        <li><strong>Page has site colors and fonts using the standard .css file:</strong> &#9745;</li>
                        <li><strong>CRAP</strong>
                            <ol type="I">
                                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> &#9745;</li>
                                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> &#9745;</li>
                                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The various elements that make up the main content either stay on the far left side or stretch across the website stretch across the full width of the screen. Setting a max width for p elements will make the text less scarce (and make paragraphs look cleaner). Aligning other elements in the center of the page will make the content look more visually appealing (and less off-balance)</li>
                                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> &#9745;</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Page has within it:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><strong>Header:</strong> &#9745;</li>
                        <li><strong>Main:</strong> Missing main element on all pages</li>
                        <li><strong>Footer:</strong> &#9745;</li>
                        <li><strong>Nav for main menu between header and main:</strong> &#9745;</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Header has site/brand header with text in an h1:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><strong>If this is a “branded page” it should be the brand/company:</strong> Heading contains page name, not company name. More written below.</li>
                        <li><strong>DO NOT INCLUDE THE PAGE NAME IN THE HEADER:</strong> The header should say "UNCC Animal Surveying Project" across all pages. Page names are written with an h2 at the top of the main element. h2 is used as for the page name and text section headings across pages. Subheadings in main should be h3 not h2.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Main starts with name of page as an h2 and does not include name of site/brand:</strong> Main content starts with an h2 across pages, but the text should be the name of the page and not the name of the text section below it.</li>
                <li><strong>Page has brand tagline somewhere (make up a slogan and include it on every page in a consistent location):</strong> No tagline is included, but I do not think it is needed if it does not fit with the design of your page. Will also check this on Campuswire.</li>
                <li><strong>Page has footer with:</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Validator is present and functional in the footer:</strong> &#9745;</li>
                <li><strong>Page has specific requirements for this assignment:</strong> See list below</li>
            </ul>
