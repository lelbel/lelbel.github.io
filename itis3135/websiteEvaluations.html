                <h3><a href="https://badhtml.com/" target="_blank">Bad HTML</a></h3>
                <p>Unlike most poorly made websites, Bad HTML is terrible on purpose. This webpage provides a variety of resources that focus on good web design practices. The helpful design advice is contrasted by eye-melting visuals that provide a great example of what not to do.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Colors are not used consistently throughout the webpage. There are too many colors in use and draws equal attention to the important and unimportant elements of the page. Font does not match the subject matter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> While the layout of the website is repeated consistent for all pages, there are elements that are repeated unnecessarily or should be removed entirely (such as the element with an unsupported plugin)</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements are consistently aligned across all pages, but the entire main element is not centered on the screen. The columns on the left and right are different widths and boxes at the bottom of the main element do not align with each other.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Various elements on the page are each spaced differently. The outline of the boxes overlap each other, giving the site a cramped appearence. Some elements do not have enough padding, making it seem like the boxes are too small for their content.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a></h3>
                <p>Steam is a video game distribution company for PC. The website mirrors the view of the desktop client, which allows users to manage their library of games. The landing page highlights "featured and recommended" games along with other site exploration options.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> A simple color scheme is used consistently with darker blues for the background and shades of white and light gray for text. Game logos and icons stand out against the background color.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The layout of the site varies in some places to apropriately fit the page's purpose, but the layout always stays consistent with itself. Every game page uses the same exacty layout, their respective content is all that differs between them. </li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Groups of information all align properly on the screen. The main content is in the exact center of the page and aligns with the top search bar and navigation menu.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Groups of displayed games are spaced differently from each other depending on their like attributes. The top sections of the landing page that highlight games that are "featured and recomended" and "special offers." They are close together, but still have space between them. A bit further below is catagories. Since that section is not showing off games directly, it is spaced a bit further to show seperation.</li>
                </ul>
